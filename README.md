PIL and pytesseract

To extract text from the image we can use the PIL and pytesseract libraries. We currently perform this step for a single image, but this can be easily modified to loop over a set of images. We can enhance the accuracy of the output by fine tuning the parameters but the objective is to show text extraction

NLP
